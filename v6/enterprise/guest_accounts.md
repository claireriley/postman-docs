Guest accounts are a feature exclusive to Enterprise that allows admins to privately share collections with guests who are not a part of their Postman team. This is ideal for sharing projects with collaborators who may not need edit permissions, such as:

* Customers to oversee what you are building for them.
* Contractors who limited access.
* Teammates who need to reference your documentation.


### Managing guest accounts

Guests do not have edit permissions and can only access collections in Postman when explictly invited to do so. Only admins can invite, manage, and remove guests.

#### Inviting guests in Dashboard

In the [Team page](https://go.postman.co/team), click the **Invite Users** button.

Enter the email address of the individual you want to invite, then click the "Developer" box that appears to their right. From the dropdown select "Guest", then click "Send invitations".

#### Managing guest access

Once a guest has accepted the invitation to join the team, you'll be able to provide them access to the desired collection(s). A guest account will be able to view and comment, however they will not be able to edit the collection itself. 

##### Granting access in Dashboard

Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://go.postman.co), then to the appropriate team workspace. Locate the collection, then select "..." to the right of it and "Manage Roles". In the new page, type the name of the guest into the search bar and select them when they appear. Click "Save Roles" to save changes.

#### Removing guests from Team

In the [Team page](https://go.postman.co/team), you will find guests listed at the bottom. Locate the guest in question and hover your cursor over their name to bring up a trash can. Click this, then "Confirm". They will no longer have access to any collections you had shared with them previously.
