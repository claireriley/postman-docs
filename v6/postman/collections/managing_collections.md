### Navigate through collections

Click on a collection to show or hide the requests that comprise the Collection. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the collections. 

### Edit and view collection details

Expand the arrow (&#9656;) to show the details view for the collection. Collapse the arrow (&#9666;) to hide the details view. You can add metadata like name and description so that all the information a developer needs to use your API is available easily.

### Share a collection

To share a collection, see [sharing collections](/docs/v6/postman/collections/sharing_collections){:target="_blank"}.

### Other collection features

#### Reorder requests

Within a collection or folder, you can reorder requests using drag and drop. You can also reorder folders within a collection using drag and drop. 

#### Save responses 

Requests can also store [sample responses](/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/responses){:target="_blank"} when saved in a collection.

#### Use examples

With [examples](/docs/v6/postman/collections/examples), you can mock raw responses and save them to a collection. Then, you’ll be able to generate a mock endpoint for each of them using Postman’s [mock service](/docs/v6/postman/mock_servers){:target="_blank"}. 

#### Add scripts

Requests stored inside a collection can contain [scripts](/docs/v6/postman/scripts/intro_to_scripts){:target="_blank"} to add dynamic behavior to the collection.

### Adding folders

Folders are a way to organize your API endpoints within a collection into intuitive and logical groups to mirror your workflow. Next to the collection to which you want to add a folder, click on the ellipsis (...) and select "Add Folder".

[![add folder from dropdown](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-addFolderDropdown.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-addFolderDropdown.png)

Add a name and description to the folder. Folders are initially ordered alphabetically by name and folder name. The description is reflected in your API documentation.

You can add deeper levels of nesting for folders. Drag and drop the folders to reorder them to create the ultimate customized folder structure.
