Published documentation enables you to share your [public API documentation](/docs/postman_for_publishers/public_api_docs){:target="_blank"} with the world. 

### Generating public documentation

You can only publish documentation for collections that you've created or have write permissions. From your collection's private documentation page, click the **Publish** button at the top of the screen.

From the **Publish Collection** page, you can select a [corresponding environment](/docs/postman/api_documentation/environments_and_environment_templates) to publish the collection. Any references to variables like {% raw %}`{{url}}`{% endraw %} in the collection will be replaced with the correct value from the environment.

Optionally, you can pick from a list of verified [custom domains](/docs/postman/api_documentation/adding_and_verifying_custom_domains) to host your API documentation. You’ll be able to view documentation on your custom domain, as well as the Postman private documentation page.

To share your API documentation with your users and the rest of the Postman community, check the box to allow others to discover your API through the [Postman API Network](/docs/v6/postman/launching_postman/newbutton#API-Network).

Verify your team name, logo, and description. Select the categories that best describe your APIs and service. Once submitted, the Postman team will review the submission for approval, and then your API will be accessible to millions of developers worldwide.

Postman allows you to customize the appearance of your published documentation pages. Add your [team logo](/docs/postman/api_documentation/adding_team_name_and_logo) and update the color theme to align with your brand. 

You can update the custom styling options either before or after you publish your documentation. Click the **Show Custom Styling Options** link to expand the section and update your color palette.

Here's an [example](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/583/coopers-meal-plan/4u2){:target="_blank"} of a collection we've published.

> **IMPORTANT:**  Any confidential information in your environment, such as **passwords and access tokens**, might be publicly visible. Remove all such information from the environment before you publish documentation with an environment.

The public documentation link always has the most up-to-date content. You don’t need to repeat the publication flow each time you want to update your documentation.

**Unpublishing documentation**

Once your collection has been published, you can return to the **Edit Published Collection** page, click the **Unpublish Collection** button at the bottom of the page.
