Postman's web [dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"} provides a number of ways to [manage your team](/docs/pro/managing_pro/inviting_and_managing). Postman Pro and Enterprise users can [add a team name and logo](/docs/postman/api_documentation/adding_team_name_and_logo) to their Postman team account.

### Custom team URLs

At Postman, we believe our product should have a clean and accessible URL design. Custom team URLs are available for Postman Pro and Enterprise users. This makes Postman features easier to access and streamlines the sign in process. 

Your team URL is shown on the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams). With a custom team URL, you can access the Postman web view by typing `<your-team-domain>.postman.co` into your browser. 

For example, if my team domain is “postmanlabs”, my custom team URL will now be `postmanlabs.postman.co`, and all features will be predictably accessible by appending `/docs`, `/monitors`, or any other Postman features.

Here's how to get your own custom team URL. You can see your current team name on the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) of the Postman web view.

If you bought Postman Pro online, your team would have a default name and URL. You can update these values now. From the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams), click the team settings button on the left, and hit “Save Changes” once you've entered your new team name and URL.
