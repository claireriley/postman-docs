You can use the Postman Pro to APIMatic Integration to back up your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint and other API Description formats. APIMatic Integration converts your Postman Collections to any major API description format and saves them to GitHub.  API Transformer uses a GitHub repository to save its documentation.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.


### Configuring APIMatic Integration

In the [Integrations page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"}, select APIMatic from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

Click the **View Details** button to see information about APImatic and how the Postman to APIMatic integration converts, formats, and saves your Postman collections to Github. 

You also can click the **Configured Integrations** tab to set up other integrations, view available integrations for Keen IO, or view all integrations.

Click the **Add Integratio**n button to display the page that lets you authorize a backup of your collection to your Github repository.

**Note**: If you are not signed in to Github, a Github login box appears. Enter your Github username and password, and click the Sign in button.

When you click the Authorize button, the authorization page to back up to Github displays.

To backup a collection periodically to a Github repository:
* Select a collection.
* Select a repository.
* Specify a directory in the repository where you want to add the collection.
* Enter a filename for the directory in the repository.
* Select the format in which you want to save the collection, such as Postman 2.0 or APIMATIC format.
* Specify the branch where you want to add the collection.

Click the **Add Integration** button. 

APIMatic converts the collection’s documentation to your format of choice and push to your GitHub repository.  Now your Postman collection automatically saves to your GitHub repo every day, in whatever API description format you selected.  API format compatibility is just moments away.
