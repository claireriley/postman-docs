### Backup your Postman Collections in Swagger, RAML, API Blueprint and other API Description formats

The Postman Pro to APIMatic Integration will convert your Postman Collections to any major API description format and save them to GitHub.  API Transformer uses a GitHub repository to save its documentation.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one now.

### Add the APIMatic Integration

In the [Integrations page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"}, select APIMatic from a list of Postman's 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

Click the **View Details** button to see information about APImatic and how the Postman to APIMatic integration converts, formats, and saves your Postman collections to Github. You also can click the Configured Integrations tab to set up other integrations, view available integrations for Keen IO, or view all integrations.

Select an existing GitHub repository, an existing Postman Collection, and relevant collection settings.

There are also some advanced options available.  You can enter a custom directory name, or leave "Postman Collections" as the default. You can specify a branch for commit, or leave "master" as the default.

Upon submit, APIMatic will convert the collection's documentation to your format of choice and push to your GitHub repository.

From now on, your Postman Collection will automatically save to your GitHub repo every day, in whatever API description format you selected.  API format compatibility is just moments away.
