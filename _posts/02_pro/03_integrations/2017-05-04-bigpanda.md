BigPanda is an IT systems management platform that aggregates and correlates IT alerts to create high-level IT incidents. It allows different services to be connected to have a single place where all the alerts can be directed to.

Setting up a BigPanda integration requires you to get an API key and configure Postman monitors. After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your Postman Monitors.


### Retrieving BigPanda app and API key

1. Log in to your BigPanda account and select "Integrations" in the header toolbar.

2. Click on `New Integration`, and select `Alerts REST API`.

### Viewing alerts in BigPanda

BigPanda gives you real-time alerting based on the results of your Postman Monitors. If there was a failed test or if an error occurred during the run, an alert would be created on BigPanda which would then alert the user.
